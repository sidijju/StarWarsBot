I find your lack of faith disturbing.
Just for once, let me look on you with my own eyes.
This is where the fun begins.
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
Be careful not to *choke* on your aspirations, Director.
LIAR!
If you're not with me, then you're my enemy
Now this is pod-racing!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Pray I don't alter it any further.
I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
Hold on. This whole operation was your idea.
Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
No. *I* am your father.
You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.
The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.
I have been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again at last.
Your powers are weak, old man.
You are unwise to lower your defences.
You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegration!
All too easy. Perhaps you're not as strong as the Emperor thought.
Impressive. Most impressive.
Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly?
There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you.
