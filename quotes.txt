Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi 1
You're my only hope
What a piece of junk! 3
She'll make point five past lightspeed
She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid
I've made a lot of special modifications myself
I love you 1
I know
You killed my father 1
No, I am your father
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? 11
I thought not
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you
It's a Sith legend
Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life
He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying
The Dark Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be *u* *n* *n* *a* *t* *u* *r* *a* *l*
He became so powerful that the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep
*Ironic*
He could save others from death, but not himself
*opera music intensifies*
Do 2
Or do not
There is no try
I don't believe it 1
That is why you fail
Is it possible to learn this power? 1
Not from a Jedi
Power 1
UNNLIIMMMIITTED POOOOWWEERRRR
I have the high ground 10
ANAKIN: You underestimate my power!
OBI-WAN: Don't try it
ANAKIN: *leaps*
OBI-WAN: *swings glow stick broadly*
ANAKIN: *screams*
OBI-WAN: You were the Chosen One!
OBI-WAN: It was said you would destroy the Sith, not join them
OBI-WAN: Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!
ANAKIN: I HATE YOU
OBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you
Master Skywalker, there are too many of them 1
*swinging glow stick sounds*
You turned her against me 1
You have done that yourself
If you're not with me 1
Then you're my enemy
If you're not with me, then you're my enemy 1
Only a Sith deals in absolutes
At last the Jedi are no more 1
Not if anything to say about it, I have!
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil! 1
Then you are lost!
It's over, Anakin 1
I have the high ground
You were the chosen one! 2
It was said you would destroy the Sith, not join them!
Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!
I hate you! 2
You were my brother, Anakin
I loved you
In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you're under arrest, Chancellor 6
SIDIOUS: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
WINDU: The Senate will decide your father
SIDIOUS: I *am* the Senate
WINDU: Not yet
SIDIOUS: It's treason then
SIDIOUS: *unleashes demonic scream*
I am the Senate 1
Not yet
The Senate will decide your fate 1
I *am* the Senate
Now this is podracing! 1
I'll try spinning!
Strike me down 1
And your journey to the Dark Side will be complete
I don't like sand 1
It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere
From my point of view 1
The Jedi are evil
Execute 1
Order 66
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi? 1
The Senate will decide your fate
Hold on 1
This whole operation was your idea
